## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project was carried out using the **Design Thinking** methodology to address a critical accessibility issue:  
> *"How can we improve the museum experience for people with visual disabilities?"*

The project focuses on two main phases:
- **Desirability**: identifying user needs using interviews, PANAS, Maslowâ€™s Pyramid, and Proxy Variable Analysis
- **Feasibility**: proposing, testing and evaluating three innovative solutions:
  - ðŸ§¤ AR gloves for tactile interaction
  - ðŸ‘ƒ Sensory necklace stimulating smell and taste
  - ðŸ“± AI-driven audio guide with vibration system

The final solution selected was the **Sensory Necklace**, based on cost-effectiveness, feasibility and user interest.
